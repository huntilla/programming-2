# Programming 2 Summer 2023

## READ the following instructions carefully.

- This repository will contain the source code for the homework assignments for the Programming2 course.
- There is a dedicated folder for each homework. Source code files for each homework should be placed in the corresponding homework folder.
  - For example, the source code for homework1 should be in the following subfolder: `homework1/src/main/java/dev/m3s/programming2/homework1/`
- The instructions for implementing and submitting homeworks are available on Moodle.
- The directory structure should not be changed.
- Existing files and folders in this template should not be removed.
- Creating a new tag is required to rerun the pipeline every time the source code is updated.
- Tags names should comply with the required format, i.e., homeworkX_vY_CustomPart, where X is the homework number (1, 2, 3, or 4), and Y is the version number (1 or 2).
  - The custom part can be chosen freely. However, incremental numbers 1,2,3, etc., are recommended.
    Examples: homework1_v1_1, homework1_v1_2, homework1_v2_1, homework1_v2_2
- When you finish the homework, create a final tag in the following format homeworkX_vY_submission, where X is the homework number, and Y is the version number you have implemented
